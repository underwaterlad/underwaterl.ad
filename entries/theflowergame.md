the flower game

25.06.25

objective  
until such time that a game rule stipulates otherwise, the goal of the flower game is to satisfy a win condition set by a player

rules  
rule 1: until such time that a game rule stipulates otherwise, the flower game is for two players and consists of any number of rounds  
rule 2: until such time that a game rule stipulates otherwise, a round consists of each player independently crafting a game rule or win condition  
rule 3: until such time that a game rule stipulates otherwise, players write down their rule or win condition in secret  
rule 4: until such time that a game rule stipulates otherwise, each player's rule or win condition is revealed and implemented simultaneously  
rule 5: until such time that a game rule stipulates otherwise, a rule cannot prevent another player from introducing rules or win conditions  
rule 6: until such time that a game rule stipulates otherwise, if a rule would negate a rule or win condition, it may specify only one rule or win condition. rules may negate mulitple rules and win conditions but only indirectly/incidentally  
rule 7: until such time that a game rule stipulates otherwise, rules apply to both players equally  
rule 8: until such time that a game rule stipulates otherwise, win conditions may be introduced only from round two

example round  
player A writes "rule 7 no longer applies"  
player B writes "if a player would win, reset the game instead"  
from the next round, rule 7 no longer applies, and players cannot win unless player B's rule is negated

and so on
