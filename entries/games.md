Various Thoughts About Video Games I Have Been Playing Lately

13.09.25

No Man's Sky  
The problem with this game on release is that the procedural generation was not as good as the developers made out to be, and also the UI was dog-ass. Now, the pro-gen is very-good-to-excellent and the UI is dog-ass and the maintenance/ugrade systems are astonishinly horrible. Inventory space is hobbled for no reason that I can discern and requires chores to expand. Your spaceship has three (3) different types of fuel which need to be topped up frequently, via chores. You and your gun run on batteries, and again, chores will help replenish them. This would be an excellent game if it didn't get in its own way at every turn.

Diablo 4  
The gameplay is now about as close to POE-esque meditative mob farming as I think it's ever going to get. And I think that's pretty good, for what it is and what it started out as. Upgrade paths and progression are very clear and obvious and mob density is pretty good, and (character) speed is generous. ARPGs are non-games which you play in the background while you watch a movie, and D4 is what you play when you want to pay even less attention than you would playing POE.

The Bazaar  
Best game of the nascent autobattler genre by some margin. Extremely well-balanced and with a high build variety at least outside of typical ranked sweat. Looks unbelievably good for an independent game, probably the first "Blizzard polish" game to be made by a company not named Blizzard.

League of Legends  
I am a psychotic and evil baboon nightmare beast. If you question ping me when I miss an ability I will instantly quit the game. I will build full attack speed Vi and farm for the first 20 minutes of the game without ganking. 70% of Bard ults will be directed at teammates who dared to comminicate with me in any way. You underestimate my ability to craft readable versions of slurs which evade game chat censorship systems. Low priority queue is a fantastic part of the game as it gives me time to make noodles while queuing. Riot Games have created a video game version of a prison and I am not locked in here with you; you are locked in here with me.
