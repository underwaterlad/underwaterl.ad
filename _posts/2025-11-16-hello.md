This website has been slapped together quickly. I think this is a good way to build a website. I'm using **[GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/what-is-github-pages)** and **[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)**, neither of which I had used before. I also hadn't used GitHub before this, which for a first-time user is freaky. Might complain about that later. The website, you might have noticed, won't dynamically fit to anything other than a regular old PC monitor, so if you are on a mobile device and are somehow reading this, apologies - this will be fixed in the near future. There is something to be said about retrofitting dynamic markup rather than just using it to begin with I am sure, so please don't say whatever that is.

Design-wise, I am reasonably happy with the site, if you care. The fixed-sidebar-with-stuff-on-the-right is I think the tried and true way to do personal websites if you want to seem mysterious and cool. I'm imagining a spectrum with this on one side and a 2004-era MySpace page on the other. We can add a Y axis later and go nuts with it maybe. I'll tweak lots of things here and there in the near term, to the site I mean. Maybe the tweaking will last forever.

Disclaimer: this is not an advertisement. I have a **[store](https://scottdonaldson.bigcartel.com/)**, which has served as my de facto personal website for a couple of years. That'll be gone shortly and replaced by Blessed Shopify Integration right here. The service subscriptions will overlap for some months but I won't let that get in the way of my disdain for Big Cartel. Unrelated, but I am going to start relentlessly promoting my **[Inprnt store](www.inprnt.com/gallery/underwaterlad/)** because I feel like I've banked up enough goodwill by not relentlessly promoting it over the past three years.

The blog-portion (the "log" - see previously-mentioned desire to seem mysterious and cool) of this website I am going to treat more like a journal rather than the ThoughtCatalog-like nonsense of the short-lived Substack and the How-To-lite wastes of time of the short-lived Patreon. There will be things about art but it's not going to be "about art". Look at the websites **[here](https://webring.xxiivv.com/)** for example. It's a great list of some pretty great websites. I think I will from time to time post and talk about my favourite art pieces, which is something I've never done before, partly because I like art for nonsophisticated reasons and partly because it's really hard to put into words why I like that art. But if turning vibes into words isn't the point of writing, I don't know what is.

Music I have been listening to lately:

**[Opeth - Still Life](https://peaceville.bandcamp.com/album/still-life-remastered)**  
**[アバドン - Perfect Fake 2](https://geometriclullaby.bandcamp.com/album/perfect-fake-2)**  
**[HEATHE - Control Your Soul's Desire For Freedom](https://hethe.bandcamp.com/album/control-your-souls-desire-for-freedom)**
