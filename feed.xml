I thought I would be rewriting whole chunks of markup, but as it turns out you can just create CSS rules that apply only once the viewport hits a particular width or aspect ratio. A long time ago I did a short website-building course which taught <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> and it was pure death from what I can remember. A couple of things remain to update, mainly the <a href="https://underwaterl.ad/works">works page</a> which looks a tad too static and uninteresting.</p>

<p>Related: around that time I also did a course on Java, and then a course on building Android apps (in Java, duh). The only thing it taught me (other than Java and whatever markup Android used at the time) was that I am not a coder. It’s super clear and obvious that you can’t get good at coding in any real meaningful way by doing courses. You need to have some inner drive to create a novel thing or solve a problem in a novel way, and I don’t have that, at least in terms of making things for a mobile phone. I am always bewilderdly impressed when I stumble across a personal website of some talented coder and they have a long list of little projects/gadgets/gizmos they have made for no other reason than they figured those things would be useful. Now that I am on GitHub for this thing right here that you are on, I bogle around and I see people with multiple daily commits (that’s GitHub-speak for “things that I did”) and I think it must be cool to have that drive to endlessly fix/tweak stuff. To even know what needs tweaked or fixed.</p>

<p>Example blog titles from these types of people that I made up:<br />
<strong>Bookending a Loom-based CMS for ANIX systems</strong><br />
<strong>Why I love the WeQiiVSYS template</strong><br />
<strong>Script for instantly adding dynamic tables to a web pages deployed with Renown 5.1</strong></p>

<p>Speaking of esoteric blogs, I’ve done some more webring bogling and stumbled across some <a href="https://xsolimini.bandcamp.com/track/dark-blue">good music</a>. Disclaimer: I really like this type of music, which I think is called breakcore, though I’m not sure. I think it’s one of those genres where there is a lot of discourse about what is “real breakcore” and “not real breakcore” and the pureheads are slowly being outnumbered by new fans (like me) who don’t know what they’re talking about. Every track from every artist in this genre sounds basically indistinguishable from any other; the tenets of the whole thing are all very nailed down. I think a lot of electronic music is like this which isn’t a bad thing at all.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Making the site work on mobile devices/vertical viewports was pretty easy, actually.

I think this is a good way to build a website. I’m using <strong><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/what-is-github-pages">GitHub Pages</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a></strong>, neither of which I had used before. I also hadn’t used GitHub before this, which for a first-time user is freaky. Might complain about that later. The website, you might have noticed, won’t dynamically fit to anything other than a regular old PC monitor, so if you are on a mobile device and are somehow reading this, apologies - this will be fixed in the near future. There is something to be said about retrofitting dynamic markup rather than just using it to begin with I am sure, so please don’t say whatever that is.</p>

<p>Design-wise, I am reasonably happy with the site, if you care. The fixed-sidebar-with-stuff-on-the-right is I think the tried and true way to do personal websites if you want to seem mysterious and cool. I’m imagining a spectrum with this on one side and a 2004-era MySpace page on the other. We can add a Y axis later and go nuts with it maybe. I’ll tweak lots of things here and there in the near term, to the site I mean. Maybe the tweaking will last forever.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: this is not an advertisement. I have a <strong><a href="https://scottdonaldson.bigcartel.com/">store</a></strong>, which has served as my de facto personal website for a couple of years. That’ll be gone shortly and replaced by Blessed Shopify Integration right here. The service subscriptions will overlap for some months but I won’t let that get in the way of my disdain for Big Cartel. Unrelated, but I am going to start relentlessly promoting my <strong><a href="www.inprnt.com/gallery/underwaterlad/">Inprnt store</a></strong> because I feel like I’ve banked up enough goodwill by not relentlessly promoting it over the past three years.</p>

<p>The blog-portion (the “log” - see previously-mentioned desire to seem mysterious and cool) of this website I am going to treat more like a journal rather than the ThoughtCatalog-like nonsense of the short-lived Substack and the How-To-lite wastes of time of the short-lived Patreon. There will be things about art but it’s not going to be “about art”. Look at the websites <strong><a href="https://webring.xxiivv.com/">here</a></strong> for example. It’s a great list of some pretty great websites. I think I will from time to time post and talk about my favourite art pieces, which is something I’ve never done before, partly because I like art for nonsophisticated reasons and partly because it’s really hard to put into words why I like that art. But if turning vibes into words isn’t the point of writing, I don’t know what is.</p>
